<h1>Active Directory - Post-Installation and Configuration</h1>

In this tutorial I will use Active directory in Azure to create a bunch of users and attempt to log into <b>client-1</b> with one of the users.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

-  More Experience with Azure (I will Create the environment here)
-  Understanding of the Domain Controler and DNS
-  Gain a better understanding of all parts of Active Directory such <b>resetting passwords<b> and <b>setting up users<b>.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Virtual Machine(DC-1)
- Virtual Machine(client-1)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory and Domain Services

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

-  Windows Server 2022
-  Windows 10 pro

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

-  All you need for this lab is to follow the <a href="https://github.com/danielbangm/configure-ad">first part </a>

<h2>Installation steps</h2>

-  Step 1: Create and Admin and Normal User Account in AD

I log into DC-1 with my username <b>daniel.com\labuser</b> because is now a Domain Controller and I go to Server Manager -> Active Directory Users and Computers. I Create 2 OU(Organizational Unit) called <b>_EMPLOYEES</b> and <b>_ADMINS</b>. Then I create a new employee named "Jane Doe" with the username "jane_admin" and add this username in the "Domain Admins" Security Group

Now I log out/close the Remote Desktop Connection to DC-1and log back in as <b>daniel.com\jane_admin</b>. The user jane_admin will be my admin account from now

-  Step 2: Join Client-1 to the Domain (daniel.com)

I go to www.portal.azure.com and make sure I change Client-1's DNS settings to the DC-1's Private IP addressv(10.0.0.4). To do this just go to Client-1 -> Networking. Then change it. After Changing the DNS IP address I make sure I restart the Virtual Machine in Azure in order to flush the DNS cache.

I use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to Client-1 and right click on Windows then System -> Rename this PC (advanced) -> Change -> daniel.com  It forces me to restart the computer.

I login to the Domain Controller via Remote Desktop to verify client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers inside the Computer container on the root of the domain.

-  Step 3: Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative Users on Client-1

I use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to Client-1 and right click on Windows then System -> Remote Desktop -> Allow Users to Remote Connect to this PC (advanced). Then I add "Domain Users".

After this, I am now able to log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user.

-  Step 4: Create a bunch of additional

I log into DC-1 as jane_admin, open the Powershell_ise as an administrator. I create a new file and paste the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/danielbangm/Generate-names-Users-ad/edit/main/README.md">script</a> into it. When I run my script, I can observe the account being created

Now when I open Active Directory Users and Computers in _EMPLOYEES OU, I can see a bunch of random users created

Just to wrap this lab up, I will attempt to log into Client-1 using one of the users just created. I chose <b>babixi.fesuji</b>
